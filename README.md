# Palette

Beautifully static - Steven Lee, 2020

## Idea's

-   Create image gallery using responsive css grid
    -   Although static site, I want to try make a server which GET's the latest instagram photos from palette page, and pushes it to Github.
    -   Use SQLite (To keep track of which photos you have processed) + nodejs
